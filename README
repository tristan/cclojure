c code heavily based on [femotolisp](https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp).

Files taken directly from [femotolisp](https://github.com/JeffBezanson/femtolisp):

c++ code is mostly my own (although somewhat influenced by femtolisp and the clojure java code), and is also an excercise in relearning c++(11), and thus will definitelly not be optimal or correct!
